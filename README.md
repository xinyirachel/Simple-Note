## **About this app**

Simple Note is a simplistic application created in React.js. The app allows notes to be posted and deleted, as well as downloaded as PDF document. The app also include some utilities for note-taking on Tools page. Enjoy and welcome to send me any question below. Simple Note is simple but powerful...at least will be powerful oneday lol. I am going to polish it forever. The original idea is to create a note-taking app similar to Google Keep. It created in React.js using diff React Hooks, state, props, and array mapping, and the . But I want to add more usefull features later and I want to style it differently.
